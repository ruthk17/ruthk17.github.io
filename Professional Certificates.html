    <u><h2>About Professional Certificates:</u></h2>
    <p>Given the plethora of online educational resources from academics, educational institutions and even just professionals with experience, I decided to capitalize upon this technological advancement called the internet and subscribe to a variety of professional specialization and professional certificate courses.</p>
    <p>While there are advantages to taking 2 to 12 years off of work and attending in person classes at a university or community college, this can be costly and is already a pathway that I have performed, for now.</p>
    <p>I am so glad to see comparable course instruction from Universities and Colleges offering interesting and relevant information online that can be accessed comfortably, conveniently, and safely. I was grateful for the opportunity to learn current and up-to-date information across industries like technology, engineering, and business; in an environment that supports the academic and business communities alike.</p>
