    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <center><img src="images/Ruth Professional Pic.JPG" width="25%"></center>
    <p>Hi, my name is Ruth King and I am a young professional that is enthusiastic about learning and working in industries that positively impact societies and progress the development of communities. Each industry, sector, or company can serve a wide range of purposes that interconnect globally, domestically and locally to enable environmental, social, and economic vitality. My vision is to be involved with efforts that collaborate to advance enterprises.</p>
    <p>I am thankful to have the opportunity to be part of the working world where teams of dedicated people work to enhance vital communities. My personal mission and aim is to continue working, learning, and growing.</p>
    <p>I admire the concept of continuous learning and improvement, and make it a weekly goal to spend time learning something new through online courses. Although some of the academic material can be dense, it is interesting to study new things. A few of my other values include respect for all citizens, openness, and integrity.</p>
